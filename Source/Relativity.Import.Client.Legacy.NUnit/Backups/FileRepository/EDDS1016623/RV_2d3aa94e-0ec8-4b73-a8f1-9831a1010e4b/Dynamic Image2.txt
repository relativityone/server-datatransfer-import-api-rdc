Subject: EDDS Import Tool: Matrix, Questions and Examples 
 
Jim, 
  
We need your help to gain a better understanding of what will be imported into EDDS.  I have created a matrix 
that outlines all the potential scenarios that the import tool will cover.  We have a number of outstanding questions 
as well.  They are listed on the second tab of the spreadsheet.  Can you take a look at the matrix for accuracy and 
answer our questions at your earliest convenience? 
  
Additionally, we would like examples of these potential scenarios.  If we had the following, I believe we could 
cover all the scenarios: 
  
1)       Bib Info + Full text in Bib File + Image File + Multi Page Tiffs + Natives 
2)       Bib Info + Full Text in Single File + Image File + Multi Page Tiffs + Natives 
3)       Bib Info + Full Text In Single File For Page + Image File + Singe Page Tiff + Natives 
  
I’m not sure if you have this stuff hanging around, or if we can create it if we install Cracker.   I would feel better if I 
got it from you guys.  At least let me know the effort and timeline on getting this stuff….it would be extremely 
useful on our end. 
  
Thanks
